Computer Extension Attributes Populated by a ScriptWhen an extension attribute is populated by a script, the text between the <result></result> tag is stored in the JSS.
For OS X computers, scripts can be written in any language that has an interpreter installed. The most common interpreters are:/bin/bash/bin/sh/usr/bin/perl/usr/bin/python
All scripts must start with a shebang (#!) followed by the absolute path to the interpreter. For example, the script for an extension attribute that collects the host name from OS X computers looks like this:
#!/bin/shecho "<result>`hostname 2>&1`</result>"
